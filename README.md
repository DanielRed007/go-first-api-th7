My First Golang API

Coming from a Javascript background, all I can say is Go looks amazing,the sintax is much more simple: 

Prequisites:

  1. Install Go > 1.16
  2. Install the Gin Web Framework

Check your current go version by typing in your project path:
  
  go version
  
Then you should run the "go mod init" command to start your new Go project

Then run the app:

  go run your-server-file.go
